# Automated WiFi Umbrella

This was part of my team's capstone project.  Using a RaspberryPi to control a mounted motor on a patio umbrella.

The code is used to create multiple umbrella nodes attached to WiFi that can be controlled from a centralized location.  The Umbrellas featured a wind sensor that would automatically close the umbrella based upon user-defined
parameters.

(WIP Need to come back and comment the code more and update readme)
